# Basics of machine learning and deep learning and its application in various fields.

1. True understanding is making all parts of a concept so clear and vivid as if they are objects in front of you that you can manipulate as you wish.
2. This repository contains a list various tasks that can be achieved with Machine Learning/Deep Learning.
3. It doesn't contain any benchmark paper because I love in doing new things rather than improving previous research.

*Pull Requests are welcome to add any new blog, paper, site link.*

## Theory:
[Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a wonderful library for implementing basic machine learning tasks.
